    <p>NEW DELHI: Days before PM Narendra Modi's visit to the US from June 21 to 25, Nasa officials are increasingly talking about roping in India for Nasa's Artemis Accords, which are an American-led effort to return humans to the Moon by 2025, with the ultimate goal of expanding space exploration to Mars and beyond.</p>

    <a href="/cricket.html"><img src="img/winner.jpg" alt="Mountains" style="width:100%"></a>
    <p>India lifted the Intercontinental Cup as it tamed a young Lebanon side by two second-half goals at the Kalinga Stadium here on Sunday. Having held to a goalless draw by Lebanon in the last league outing of the tournament, India doubled its bid to find the break as Lebanon dug its heels in defence. Finishing woes continued to bother India in the unproductive opening session which saw the host making a few openings but failing to convert.</p>

                <P>On Bigg Boss OTT 2 Weekend Ka Vaar, Salman Khan pulled up Jad Hadid for kissing Akanksha Puri during the task and showing his buttocks to Bebika Dhurve during a fight.</P>
                <p>Salman Khan is probably one of the few stars, who has stayed away from kissing on-screen. The Bollywood star was thus left aghast when Akanksha Puri and Jad Hadid locked lips on Bigg Boss OTT 2 recently. As Salman returned for the Weekend Ka Vaar, he pulled up the two contestants, especially Jad, who had even left housemates shocked after he flashed his posterior to Bebika Dhurve during a fight.</p>

                    <p>The country’s progress towards social harmony, economic and gender justice has been hampered by the absence of a Uniform Civil Code</p>
                    <p>India, being a diverse nation, is home to many religions, each with its distinct personal laws governing marriage, divorce, adoption, inheritance and succession. It would be accurate to say that the absence of a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) has only served to perpetuate inequalities and inconsistencies in our land of rich diversity. In fact, this has been a hindrance in the nation’s progress towards social harmony, economic and gender justice. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had last week called for the enactment of a UCC, pointing out the anomaly of having varying laws for different categories of citizens.</p>
